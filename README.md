# SD-YOLO: A lightweight steel surface defect detection model with dynamic parameterisation for adaptive feature modulation
## Introduction
Here is the paper we publish "SD-YOLO: A lightweight steel surface defect detection model with dynamic parameterisation for adaptive feature modulation".

## ðŸš€ Training
DPEM is in nn\extra modules\block.py

## :trophy: Result
Our proposed method achieves better performance on NEU-DET and GC10-DET.
